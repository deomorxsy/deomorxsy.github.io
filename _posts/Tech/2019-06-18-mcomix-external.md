### Mcomix

MComix is a user-friendly, customizable image viewer, created from a fork of the Comix project. It is specifically designed to handle comic books (both Western comics and manga) and supports a variety of container formats (including CBR, CBZ, CB7, CBT, LHA and PDF). It is written in Python using GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings, and runs on both Linux and Windows.[source](https://sourceforge.net/p/mcomix/wiki/Home/)


The program doesn't have enough functionalities, so they allow the user to define a list of **external commands** that can be 	executed at will (and it's a very powerful functionality itself).

- *The relevant menu can be accessed via "Fileâ†’Open with". Initially, this submenu will be empty. New commands can be added with the "Edit commands" menu item.*

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends
of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
eat: it was a [hobbit-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles"), and that means comfort.
