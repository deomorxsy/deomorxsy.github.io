<p>MComix is a user-friendly, customizable image viewer, created from a fork of the Comix project. It is specifically designed to handle comic books (both Western comics and manga) and supports a variety of container formats (including CBR, CBZ, CB7, CBT, LHA and PDF). It is written in Python using GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings, and runs on both Linux and Windows.<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mcomix/wiki/Home/">source</a></p>

<p>The program doesn’t have enough functionalities, so they allow the user to define a list of <strong>external commands</strong> that can be 	executed at will (and it’s a very powerful functionality itself).</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>The relevant menu can be accessed via “File→Open with”. Initially, this submenu will be empty. New commands can be added with the “Edit commands” menu item.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>MComix can run a list of user-defined commands on the currently opened file/directory/archive. This might include external image viewers, file management tools or custom shell scripts. For this specific guide, we will use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.</p>

<p>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends
of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
eat: it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle" title="Hobbit lifestyles">hobbit-hole</a>, and that means comfort.
