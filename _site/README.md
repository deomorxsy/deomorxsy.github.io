# About
my personal website, built from the scratch by testing css and html features. The template is originally from the "[Getting started with the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)" series on Mozilla Developer website, adapted to Jekyll inspirated by some gith-pages. Ongoing.
