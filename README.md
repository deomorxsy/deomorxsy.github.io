my old personal website built from scratch using jekyll and deployed to github-pages. Currently trying Continuous Integration with the Github Action Workflows at the main branch of this repo, based on the [deploy-pages](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages) template and [doutv's workaround solution](https://gist.github.com/doutv/54098c2c283ed8141ba961c88a2d5bb0) using the [ssh-agent](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/webfactory-ssh-agent) template. Tags scripting based on [Åšlimak's post](https://blog.lunarlogic.com/2019/managing-tags-in-jekyll-blog-easily/).
